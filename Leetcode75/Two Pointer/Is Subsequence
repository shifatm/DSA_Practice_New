Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters 
without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

C++ Solution

TC: O(N), SC: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int s_size = s.length();
        int t_size = t.length();
        int index = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<t_size; i++){
            if(s[index] == t[i]){
                index++;
            }
        }
        if(index == s_size) return true;
        else return false;
        
    }
};
