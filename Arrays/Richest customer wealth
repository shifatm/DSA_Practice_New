    int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
        int maxWealth = 0;
        int sum=0;
        int n = accounts.size();
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
           sum = accumulate(accounts[i].begin(), accounts[i].end(), 0);
           if(sum>maxWealth){
               maxWealth = sum;
           }
        }
